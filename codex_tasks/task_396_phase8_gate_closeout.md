## Goal (Base Required)
- What to change:
  - Phase 8 Gate Closeout를 P8 단계에서 실행 가능한 단위로 구현한다.
- What must NOT change:
  - 본 태스크 범위를 벗어난 기능 추가/리팩토링을 금지한다.

## Scope (Base Required)

Touched files/directories:
- v10/src/features/mod-studio, v10/src/core/mod/package, v10/src/core/mod/contracts

Out of scope:
- 새 AI 기능

---

## Dependencies / Constraints (Base Required)

- New dependencies allowed: NO (default)
- Boundary rules:
  - Follow scripts/check_layer_rules.sh and scripts/check_mod_contract.sh.
  - No direct mod or package import from layout internals except designated bridge.
- Compatibility:
  - 승인된 정책 컷오버 외의 동작 호환성 유지.

---

## DAG / Wave Metadata (Base Required)

- Wave ID:
  - P8
- Depends on tasks:
  - ['task_394','task_395']
- Enables tasks:
  - ['task_397']
- Parallel group:
  - G-P8-CLOSE
- Max parallel slots:
  - 6 (default)
- Verification stage for this task:
  - end

---

## Execution Mode Assessment (Base Required for new specs)

- Touched file count:
  - 3 to 9
- Files shared with other PENDING tasks:
  - AppLayout, FloatingToolbar, panelAdapters, registry/store hotspots when applicable
- Cross-module dependency:
  - YES
- Parallelizable sub-units:
  - 2
- Estimated single-agent duration:
  - about 25 to 45min
- Recommended mode:
  - MANUAL
- Batch-eligible:
  - YES
  - If YES, one-file-one-owner lock mandatory.
- Rationale:
  - 임계 파일은 직렬로, 독립 파일은 병렬로 처리해 속도와 안정성을 함께 확보.
