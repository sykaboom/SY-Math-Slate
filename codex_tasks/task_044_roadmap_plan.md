# Task 044: Post-Refactor Roadmap Plan

**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Assignee:** Codex CLI  
**Dependencies:** Task 043

## Context
Refactors are complete and AI_READ_ME is deep. We need a concise, explicit plan for next work so agents can follow a shared sequence without re-deriving intent.

## Goals
1) Capture the next work phases (UX, extensibility, stability).
2) Define priority order with dependencies.
3) Keep a single source of truth for upcoming work.

## Scope (touched files)
- `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` (new)

## Requirements
1) Include three tracks:
   - UX parity with legacy (cursor/break feedback, real-time layout feedback).
   - Extensibility execution layer (runtime, permissions, connectors).
   - Stability/QA (regressions, hydration, perf).
2) Provide sequencing and dependencies.
3) Keep it concise but explicit.

## Acceptance Criteria
1) `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` exists with phases and priorities.

## Manual Verification
1) Open `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` and confirm phases/tracks are listed.

## Closeout Notes
- Added `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` with three-track plan and sequencing.
