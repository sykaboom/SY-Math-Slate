# Task 373: Theme UX and JSON IO Hardening

Status: PENDING
Owner: Codex (spec / review / implementation)
Target: v10/
Date: 2026-02-21

---

## Goal (Base Required)
- What to change:
  - Provide basic user picker and advanced authoring JSON import export with preview and rollback safeguards.
- What must NOT change:
  - Do not expose unsafe free-form style execution.

---

## Scope (Base Required)

Touched files/directories:
- v10/src/features/theme/ui, v10/src/features/theme/io, v10/src/core/config/themeTokens.ts

Out of scope:
- Mod package runtime logic is excluded.

---

## Dependencies / Constraints (Base Required)

- New dependencies allowed: NO (default)
- Boundary rules:
  - Follow scripts/check_layer_rules.sh and scripts/check_mod_contract.sh.
  - No direct mod or package import from layout internals except designated bridge.
- Compatibility:
  - Existing runtime behaviors remain backward-compatible unless explicitly approved in this task.

---

## DAG / Wave Metadata (Base Required)

- Wave ID:
  - P5
- Depends on tasks:
  - ['task_372']
- Enables tasks:
  - ['task_374']
- Parallel group:
  - G5-theme
- Max parallel slots:
  - 6 (default)
- Verification stage for this task:
  - end

---

## Execution Mode Assessment (Base Required for new specs)

- Touched file count:
  - 3 to 9
- Files shared with other PENDING tasks:
  - theme panels io utilities overlap
- Cross-module dependency:
  - YES
- Parallelizable sub-units:
  - 2
- Estimated single-agent duration:
  - about 40min
- Recommended mode:
  - MANUAL
- Batch-eligible:
  - YES
  - If YES, respect file ownership lock when sharing AppLayout, FloatingToolbar, panelAdapters.
- Rationale:
  - Keep critical-path files serialized and parallelize independent policy, command, store, docs units.

## Optional Block A — Layout / SVG Gate

- [ ] Applies: NO

---

## Optional Block B — Delegated Execution

- [ ] Applies: NO

If NO:
- Execution mode: MANUAL

---

## Optional Block C — Hotfix Exception

- [ ] Applies: NO

---

## Optional Block D — Speculative Defense Check

- [ ] Applies: NO

---

## Optional Block E — Documentation Update Check

- [ ] Applies: YES
- If YES:
  - [ ] Structure changes file folder add move delete:
    - Run node scripts/gen_ai_read_me_map.mjs
    - Verify v10/AI_READ_ME_MAP.md update if needed
  - [ ] Semantic or rule changes:
    - Verify v10/AI_READ_ME.md update if needed

---

## Acceptance Criteria (Base Required)

- [ ] AC-1: Basic users can switch presets without editing raw token JSON.
- [ ] AC-2: Advanced users can import export validated theme JSON with preview and one-click rollback.
- [ ] AC-3: Invalid payload is rejected safely with actionable error.

---

## Manual Verification Steps (Base Required)

1) Step:
   - Command or click path:
     - Run import export roundtrip and malformed payload rejection tests.
   - Expected result:
     - Matches AC-1 and AC-2.
   - Covers: AC-1, AC-2

2) Step:
   - Command or click path:
     - Run cd v10 and npm run lint and npm run build.
   - Expected result:
     - Matches AC-3 and no unintended regressions.
   - Covers: AC-3

---

## Risks / Roll-back Notes (Base Required)

- Risks:
  - Malformed payload handling can regress and break theme runtime.
- Roll-back:
  - Disable JSON apply path and keep preset-only mode as rollback.

---

## Approval Gate (Base Required)

- [ ] Spec self-reviewed by Codex
- [ ] Explicit user approval received (or delegated chain approval reference)

> Implementation MUST NOT begin until both boxes are checked.
